## About

datamocktool (dmt) is a simple package for unit testing dbt projects.

Using dmt, you can create mock CSV seeds to stand in for the sources and refs that your models use
and test that the model produces the desired output (using another CSV seed).

## Requirements

- dbt version:
  - 1.0 or greater for datamocktool>=0.1.8
  - 0.19.2 or greater for datamocktool<0.1.8
- BigQuery, Redshift, Postgres, or SQL Server (likely works on Snowflake but has not been specifically tested)

## Quickstart

1. Install this package by adding the following to your `packages.yml` file:
   - ```yaml
     - package: mjirv/dbt_datamocktool
       version: [">=0.1.10"]
     ```
2. Create your mocks: sample inputs for your models and the expected outputs of those models given the inputs.
   - Save them to your seeds directory (usually `data/`; note that you can use any folder structure you would like within that directory)
   - See the `integration_tests/data/` directory of this project for some examples
3. Define your tests: Add unit tests to your `schema.yml` files, using the following example:

   - ```yaml
     models:
       - name: stg_customers
         tests:
           - dbt_datamocktool.unit_test:
               input_mapping:
                 source('jaffle_shop', 'raw_customers'): ref('dmt__raw_customers_1')
               expected_output: ref('dmt__expected_stg_customers_1')
               depends_on:
                 - ref('raw_customers')
         columns: ...

       - name: stg_orders
         tests:
           - dbt_datamocktool.unit_test:
               input_mapping:
                 ref('raw_orders'): ref('dmt__raw_orders_1')
               expected_output: ref('dmt__expected_stg_orders_1')
         columns: ...
     ```

4. Run your tests: `dbt deps && dbt seed && dbt test`

## Advanced Usage

### Using Other Materializations

Inputs can also be models, SQL statements, and/or macros instead of seeds. See `integration_tests/macros/dmt_raw_customers.sql` and the related test in `integration_tests/models/staging/schema.yml` where this is implemented (copied below).

Note that you must wrap your SQL in parentheses in order to create a valid subquery, as below.

Expected outputs _must_ be seeds or models because the `dbt_utils.equality` test expects a relation. If you want to write SQL instead of a CSV for the expectation, you can use a model that is materialized as a view. See `integration_tests/models/unit_test_helpers/dmt__expected_stg_customers_2.sql` where this is implemented (copied below).

Test:

```yaml
- dbt_datamocktool.unit_test:
    input_mapping:
      source('jaffle_shop', 'raw_customers'): "{{ dmt_raw_customers() }}" # this is a macro
    expected_output: ref('dmt__expected_stg_customers_2') # this is a model
```

Model (expected output):

```sql
  {{
      config(materialized='view')
  }}

  select 1 as customer_id, 'Michael' as first_name, 'P.' as last_name
  union all
  select 2 as customer_id, 'Shawn' as first_name, 'M.' as last_name
```

Macro (input):

```sql
  {% macro dmt_raw_customers() %}
    (

    {% set records = [
        [1,"Michael","P."],
        [2,"Shawn","M."]
    ] %}

    {% for record in records %}
        select {{ record[0] }} as id, '{{ record[1] }}' as first_name, '{{ record[2] }}' as last_name
        {% if not loop.last %}
            union all
        {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
    ) raw_customers
{% endmacro %}
```

### Test Names/Descriptions

You can add optional names and descriptions to your tests to make them easier to work with.

For example:

```yaml
- dbt_datamocktool.unit_test:
    input_mapping:
      source('jaffle_shop', 'raw_customers'): "{{ dmt_raw_customers() }}" # this is a macro
    expected_output: ref('dmt__expected_stg_customers_2') # this is a model
    name: "Raw Customers 2"
    description: "This test is a unit test"
```

will show up in your test run as follows:

```python
21:37:48 | 4 of 23 START test dbt_datamocktool_unit_test_stg_customers_This_test_is_a_unit_test__ref_dmt__expected_stg_customers_2____dmt_raw_customers___Raw_Customers_2 [RUN]
21:37:49 | 4 of 23 PASS dbt_datamocktool_unit_test_stg_customers_This_test_is_a_unit_test__ref_dmt__expected_stg_customers_2____dmt_raw_customers___Raw_Customers_2 [PASS in 0.27s]
```

### Compare Columns

If you only want to mock a few columns, you can do so and use the `compare_columns` field to tell the test which columns to look at, like so:

```yaml
models:
  - name: stg_customers
    tests:
      - dbt_datamocktool.unit_test:
          input_mapping:
            source('jaffle_shop', 'raw_customers'): ref('dmt__raw_customers_1')
          expected_output: ref('dmt__expected_stg_customers_1')
          compare_columns:
            - first_name
            - last_name
    columns: ...
```

### Manual Dependencies

Sometimes dbt won't pick up all the needed dependencies. You can manually add dependencies using `depends_on`:

```yaml
models:
  - name: stg_customers
    tests:
      - dbt_datamocktool.unit_test:
          input_mapping:
            source('jaffle_shop', 'raw_customers'): ref('dmt__raw_customers_1')
          expected_output: ref('dmt__expected_stg_customers_1')
          depends_on:
            - ref('raw_customers')
    columns: ...
```

### Support multiple test cases

It is also possible to support the same model unit test over multiple test cases. Keeping the yaml config concise, but still easily identifying the specific test cases that are failing.

* `test_case_list`: new optional field, expects an array with the test cases to be applied on `input_mapping` and `expected_output`
* `@`: The special character to be used as template for string substitution, iterating through the values of `test_case_list`
* `\`: the special character added to the beginning of the value. This is required to stop Jinja automatically rendering the value (i.e: `ref()`, `source()` etc.)

```yaml
models:
  - name: stg_customers
    tests:
      - dbt_datamocktool.unit_test:
          tags: 
            - example_tag_unit_test 
          test_case_list: [1,2,3,5,8,13,21]
          input_mapping:
            source('jaffle_shop', 'raw_customers'): \ref('dmt__raw_customers_@')
          expected_output: \ref('dmt__expected_stg_customers_@')
```

This will result in a **single** test being executed. But under the hood, all test cases listed are checked. Any error count is passed as the test output.

In case of any failures, the **single** test will return a count of errors > 0, making it a "dbt-test failure". The full log will contain a list of all failing tests.

### Visibility on test failure
TODO: if storing result as a view, it is possible to inspect the mocked model code, making it easier to debug issues with failing tests.
